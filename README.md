# SkillForge-Prototype

SkillForge-Prototype is a web-based productivity dashboard designed to turn skill development and project management into an adventure. Track your projects as "quests," earn XP for completing tasks, and visualize your growing expertise with an interactive skill universe map powered by D3.js.

This prototype was built using HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript, with significant assistance from **Google's Gemini** for coding, feature implementation, and debugging.
